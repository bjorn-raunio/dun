# Zone of Control Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully consolidated all zone of control calculations into a single utility module (`src/utils/zoneOfControl.ts`) to eliminate code duplication between `src/validation/movement.ts` and `src/utils/pathfinding.ts`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Centralized Module: `src/utils/zoneOfControl.ts`

**New Functions:**
- `isInZoneOfControl(x, y, creature)` - Check if position is within creature's zone of control
- `isInZoneOfControlWithRange(x, y, creature, zoneRange)` - Check with custom range
- `pathPassesThroughZoneOfControl(fromX, fromY, toX, toY, creature)` - Check if path passes through zone
- `pathPassesThroughHostileZones(creature, fromX, fromY, toX, toY, allCreatures)` - Check if path passes through any hostile zones
- `getEngagingCreatures(creature, allCreatures)` - Get all creatures engaging a given creature
- `isEngaged(creature, allCreatures)` - Check if creature is engaged
- `isAdjacentToCreature(x, y, creature)` - Check if position is adjacent to creature
- `getZoneOfControlRange(creature)` - Get creature's zone of control range

### 2. Updated `src/validation/movement.ts`

**Removed Duplicate Functions:**
- Removed `pathPassesThroughZoneOfControl()` function (was duplicated)
- Removed manual zone of control calculations

**Updated Functions:**
- `validateEngagementMovement()` - Now uses centralized utilities
- `validatePathThroughZones()` - Now uses centralized utilities

**Added Imports:**
- Imported centralized zone of control utilities

### 3. Updated `src/utils/pathfinding.ts`

**Removed Duplicate Functions:**
- Removed `pathPassesThroughZoneOfControl()` private method (was duplicated)

**Updated Functions:**
- `getReachableTiles()` - Now uses centralized zone of control utilities for engagement checks

**Added Imports:**
- Imported centralized zone of control utilities

### 4. Updated `src/creatures/movement.ts`

**Updated Functions:**
- `moveTo()` - Now uses centralized zone of control utilities

**Added Imports:**
- Imported centralized zone of control utilities

### 5. Updated `src/utils/index.ts`

**Added Export:**
- Added export for the new `zoneOfControl` module

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Eliminated Code Duplication**
- Removed duplicate `pathPassesThroughZoneOfControl()` implementations
- Removed duplicate zone of control calculation patterns
- Removed duplicate adjacency checking logic

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- All zone of control logic is now centralized in one module
- Changes to zone of control logic only need to be made in one place
- Consistent behavior across all modules

### 3. **Better Code Organization**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Zone of control logic is now a dedicated utility module
- Easier to test and debug zone of control functionality

### 4. **Enhanced Reusability**
- Zone of control utilities can be easily imported and used by any module
- Consistent API for all zone of control operations
- Reduced coupling between modules

## Files Modified

1. **Created:** `src/utils/zoneOfControl.ts` - New centralized module
2. **Modified:** `src/validation/movement.ts` - Removed duplicates, added imports
3. **Modified:** `src/utils/pathfinding.ts` - Removed duplicates, added imports
4. **Modified:** `src/creatures/movement.ts` - Updated to use centralized utilities
5. **Modified:** `src/utils/index.ts` - Added export for new module

## Testing

- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Only minor warnings about unused variables (not related to refactoring)

## Future Improvements

1. **Consider updating base creature class** - The `Creature` base class still has its own `getEngagingCreatures()` method. These could potentially be refactored to use the centralized utilities, but care must be taken to avoid circular dependencies.

2. **Add unit tests** - The new centralized module should have comprehensive unit tests to ensure all zone of control logic works correctly.

3. **Performance optimization** - The centralized utilities could be optimized for performance if needed, especially for frequently called functions.

## Conclusion

The zone of control refactoring has been successfully completed. All duplicate code has been eliminated, and the zone of control logic is now centralized in a single, well-organized utility module. The codebase is now more maintainable, consistent, and easier to work with.
