    You are in one of the many taverns that flourish in Verneck. Since the city is home to a multitude of merchants, it has become a bustling place where travelllers of all races and places from all over the world converge. 
Trade attracts money, and money attracts adventurers, thieves and bounty hunters. 

The city remains a pigsty surrounded by a low stone wall, and its suburbs extend into the outskirts, merging with spaces dedicated to orchards and farms. New stone houses have hardly been erected because most of those 
who spend the night are passing through. The inhabitants of the city are still suspicious of foreigners in just the same way as when the city had barely any movement.

The eternal rivalries between Alania's nobels still persist. It has always been a troubled region, perhaps becauseit is located at a crossroads, or because of the balanceof forces among the different nobel houses. After 
the independence of Pulse, internal quarrels and disputes returned. Now, the governor of Verneck suspects that the Count of the neighbouring region of Aitania is hiring bandits to assault the caravans of merchants 
crossing the Asdurag. Count Ricierd uses this ploy to redirect the traffic so that the merchants can divert northwards and participate in the small riverbank markets that belong to him. Hart, governor of Verneck, 
wants to take tough measures against his neighbour, but first he needs to confirm his suspicions. That is why he has commisioned Arthos, head of the city guard, to look for volunteers to intercept these bandits and 
make them confess whether they are acting on their own or under Ricierd's directives. You will be generously rewarded if you succeed in the mission.
